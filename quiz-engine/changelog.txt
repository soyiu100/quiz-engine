- picked up on bug on 1-3 path, where after deleting or creating a course, courses
are not added, due the way that it is implemented (so I added new methods to make 
up for that implementation)
- 1-4 path should also be relatively complete, where repeating prompt issues have been fixed
- paths 1-1 and 1-2 now account for whether the files actually exists (or not exist), 
and respond according
	- also path 1-2 is more clearly acknowledged now! (wow) although that may mean more refactoring

12/28/2018
- lot of changes that I haven't been able to keep track of (b/c I forgot this log existed):
- biggest change is progress in implementing QuestionEditor to extend the abstract class,
as well as cleaning up the packages so that their purposes are separated
- at this point, the path 1-3 is definitely working, might need to pick up a few bugs
- also, working on other paths so that they at least function
