s~(From exam3a.pdf) Let A be an n x n matrix such that A^3 = O. 
Note that A may not be the zero matrix.
Prove that A cannot be invertible and is therefore singular.
*If A were invertible, then (A^-1)^3(A^3) should be equal to
the identity matrix. But that expression is equivalent to 
(A^-1)^3(O), which cannot be equal to the identity matrix.
*If A were invertible, then the det(A) != 0. But det(A^3) = 0,
and det(A^3) is equal to (det(A))^3 = 0. So det(A) = 0.
s~(From exam3a.pdf) Give an example of a linearly independent set in R^3 that is not a basis for R^3.

e~(I just thought this problem was clever)
Influenza levinsonia is spreading. Let’s represent the population as a vector:
x = 
[x1
x2
x3]
=
[# at-risk people
# sick people
# recovered people]
in the span of R^3.
Each week, the vector x changes as follows:
-1/2 the at-risk group becomes sick; the other 1/2 stays healthy.
-70% of the sick group stays sick; the other 30% recovers and becomes immune.
For example, if x =
[40
100
5]
today, then in one week it will be
