e~What is a load factor?
^(number of elements)/(table size)
e~Within a RecursiveTask or RecursiveAction, what are the
three essential lines that do the computation of the split
results?
^right.fork()
left.compute()
right.join()
s~What is a race condition?
*When the computation result depends on how the threads are interleaved
s~What is a data race?
*Either writing a variable at the same time or writing a variable while reading a variable.
s~In a class with previously unsynchronized methods, if we
synchronize a single method (let's call it foo()), are there any
improvements to either:
a race condition,
potential for deadlock,
a data race?
If so, what improvements are made?
*Calls to foo() from two different threads will not cause a race condition anymore.
s~Equation for maximum speedup?
*T,1/T,inf
*1/(percent sequential)
e~When is quadratic probing not guaranteed to be able to find a location in a hash table?
^when it is more than half full
e~Runtime of Dijkstra's with a priority queue?
^O(VlogV + ElogV)
e^Runtime of Dijkstra's without a priority queue?
^O(V^2 + E)
